Four	1
score	1
and	1
seven	1
years	1
ago	1
our	1
fathers	1
brought	1
forth	1
on	1
this	1
continent,	1
a	1
new	1
nation,	1
conceived	1
in	1
Liberty,	1
and	1
dedicated	1
to	1
the	1
proposition	1
that	1
all	1
men	1
are	1
created	1
equal.	1
Now	1
we	1
are	1
engaged	1
in	1
a	1
great	1
civil	1
war,	1
testing	1
whether	1
that	1
nation,	1
or	1
any	1
nation	1
so	1
conceived	1
and	1
so	1
dedicated,	1
can	1
long	1
endure.	1
We	1
are	1
met	1
on	1
a	1
great	1
battle-field	1
of	1
that	1
war.	1
We	1
have	1
come	1
to	1
dedicate	1
a	1
portion	1
of	1
that	1
field,	1
as	1
a	1
final	1
resting	1
place	1
for	1
those	1
who	1
here	1
gave	1
their	1
lives	1
that	1
that	1
nation	1
might	1
live.	1
It	1
is	1
altogether	1
fitting	1
and	1
proper	1
that	1
we	1
should	1
do	1
this.	1
